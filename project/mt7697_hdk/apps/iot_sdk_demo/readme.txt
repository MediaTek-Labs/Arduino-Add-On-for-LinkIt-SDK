@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - J36 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, SPI master chip select 0, SPI
      master, UART1 RX/TX.
    - J35 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RX/TX, UART1 RTS/CTS, SPI
      master chip select 1, IR TX and IR RX.
    - J34 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RTS/CTS, I2S, SPI slave,
      and I2C0.
    - J33 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, I2C0, ADC0~3.
    - J32 provides the pins for GND, 5V, 3.3V and reset pin.
    - J25 sets the HDK to either Flash Normal mode or Flash Recovery mode. To
      update the firmware on the LinkIt 7697 HDK:
      - Set the jumper J25 to FLASH Recovery mode, the jumpers J23, J26, J27
        and J30 should be on.
      - In this mode, if the power is on, the board will load ROM code and
        start the ATE Daemon or Firmware Upgrade Daemon according to the
        MT76x7 Flash Tool's behavior on the PC. To run the project on the
        LinkIt 7697 HDK:
      - Set the jumper J25 off to switch to FLASH Normal mode, the jumpers
        J23, J26, J27 and J30 should be on.
      - In this mode, if the power is on, the board will load firmware from
        the flash and reboot.
    - There are three buttons on the board:
      - RST - reset.
      - EINT - external interrupt.
      - RTC_INT - RTC interrupt.
  - Environment configuration
    - A serial tool is required, such as TeraTerm for UART logging.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt7697_hdk
    iot_sdk" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to the
    LinkIt 7697 development board.
  - Reboot the HDK, the console will show "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate the HDK is booting up.
  - Use '?' and enter to query the available command line options. Note that
    the command line options are still under development and subject to
    change without notice.
  - Reference applications run the LinkIt 7697 HDK in Wi-Fi station and
    access point modes and connect the HDK with nearby Bluetooth LE enabled
    devices.
  - Example 1. Wi-Fi station mode.
    - Find your Wi-Fi access point settings: Before connecting to a Wi-Fi
      access point, the following information needs to be collected: 1. The
      SSID of your Wi-Fi access point. 2. The authentication mode of your Wi-
      Fi access point. In general, the authentication mode is WPA PSK or WPA2
      PSK. To change the mode, please refer to Table 1 for the list of
      supported authentication modes. 3. The password of your Wi-Fi access
      point. 4. The encryption mode of your Wi-Fi access point. In general,
      AES or TKIP is used. To change the mode, please refer to Table 2 for
      the list of supported encryption modes.
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the LinkIt 7697 HDK. The example code in main.c assumes
      either WPA PSK or WPA2 PSK is used for authentication, TKIP or AES for
      encryption, 'myhome' (length 6) for the SSID, and the password of the
      WPA or WPA2 is '12345678' (length 8).
      \code
      config write STA AuthMode 9
      config write STA EncrypType 8
      config write STA Ssid myhome
      config write STA SsidLen 6
      config write STA WpaPsk 12345678
      config write STA WpaPskLen 8
      config write common OpMode 1
      \endcode press the reset button on the LinkIt 7697 HDK to restart the system.
    - Boot up with the new configuration. If everything is correct, similar
      messages will be shown in the console to notify your HDK has received
      an IP address.
      \code
      ************************
      DHCP got IP:10.10.10.101
      ************************
      \endcode
    - PING from the LinkIt 7697 HDK (SDK v3.1.0) If the IP address is fetched
      and the network is operating, the LinkIt 7697 can ping other devices on
      the network with the following command in the console.
      \code
      f 11 10.10.10.254 3 64
      \endcode The ping stops after sending three packets to 10.10.10.254. The ping usage is: f 11 <ip address> <times> <ping packet length>
    - Wi-Fi configuration options for AuthMode and EncrypType.

  - Example 2. Wi-Fi access point mode.
    - Provide the Wi-Fi access point settings:
      - SSID
      - Authentication Mode
      - Encryption Type
      - Password
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the LinkIt 7697 HDK. This example assumes WPA2 PSK is used
      for authentication, AES for encryption, 'iot_ap' (length 6) for the
      SSID, and the password of the WPA2 is '87654321' (length 8).
      \code
      config write AP Ssid iot_ap
      config write AP SsidLen 6
      config write AP AuthMode 7
      config write AP EncrypType 6
      config write AP WpaPsk 87654321
      config write AP WpaPskLen 8
      config write common OpMode 2
      \endcode
    - Press the reset button on the LinkIt 7697 HDK to restart the system.
    - Use a handheld device or a laptop computer to connect to the access
      point 'iot_ap'. In the development board's console, the IP address
      assigned to the handheld device or laptop is shown below.
      \code
      [DHCPD:DBG]lease_ip:10.10.10.2
      \endcode
  - Example 3. Connect to a Bluetooth LE device.
    - Use the command "log set BT on info", "log set BTMM on info", "log set
      BTHCI on info" and "log set BTL2CAP on info" to enable the BT system
      log.
    - Use the command 'ble ?' and enter to query the available Bluetooth
      command line options.
    - Input the command "ble gap start_scan 0 0024 0011 1 0" in the serial
      tool to scan for the nearby Bluetooth enabled devices.
      - 0, passive scan.
      - 0024, scan interval (36 * 0.625 ms). Two bytes long HEX value.
      - 0011, scan window (17 * 0.625 ms). Two bytes long HEX value.
      - 1, own address type, 1 means random address.
      - 0, filter policy. A similar log is written to the output:
